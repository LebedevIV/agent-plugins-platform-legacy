An open-source platform for building secure, powerful, AI-driven browser plugins. Our goal is to empower developers to create lightweight, sandboxed tools that can automate web tasks and extend browser capabilities safely.

## The Vision

Imagine a world where you can easily install a small, secure plugin to:
*   Analyze product reviews on any e-commerce site.
*   Automate your social media interactions.
*   Summarize complex articles.
*   Integrate web pages with your favorite messengers.

APP is the engine designed to make this a reality.

## Core Principles

*   **Security First:** Plugins run in a sandboxed WebAssembly (WASM) environment using Pyodide. They only get access to browser resources that the user explicitly approves.
*   **Developer Simplicity:** The primary protocol for invoking tools is MCP (Model-Context-Protocol) due to its extreme simplicity, removing the need for web servers or complex boilerplate.
*   **User Control:** The user is always in control, granting granular permissions to each plugin.
*   **Host Agnostic:** While initially designed for NanoBrowser, the platform is being built to be integrated into any host environment (other extensions, VS Code, etc.).

## Current Status

**⚠️ This project is in a very early alpha stage.**

The core architecture is being designed and implemented. It is not yet ready for production use. The API is unstable and will change frequently.

## Getting Involved

Right now, the best way to contribute is to:
*   "Watch" this repository to follow our progress.
*   Participate in Discussions and Issues.
*   Share your ideas for potential plugins and platform features.
